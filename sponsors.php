                  <img style="width:100%;" src="./img/2016_sponsors_logos/claude_bernard.jpg"/>
                  <p>Claude Bernard, the innovative watch manufacturer in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland, produces exquisite Swiss Made classic timepieces with an eminent watchmaking heritage of over 40 years since 1973. With the rising trend towards bespoke fashion with its emphasis on hand-made products, discerning consumers are now looking much more closely at the quality of craftsmanship over a mere brand name — and Claude Bernard is no exception, offering timepieces individually hand-assembled with genuine Swiss Made precision movements. Sophistication does not need to come with a hefty price tag as Claude Bernard is a highly accessible watch that is designed for the customer with an eye for refinement. In an era where fast technology and fast fashion reign supreme, the Claude Bernard Swiss Made watch is the panacea for the soul, embodying the art of gracious living for those who take the time out to appreciate the finer things in life — quality, reliability and an undisputed elegance that only a hand-assembled Swiss Made timepiece can offer.</p>
